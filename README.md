# Data-Analysis-in-R

# KNN-Imputation
The dataset used for the imputation can be found on the link: https://www.kaggle.com/carlolepelaars/toy-dataset
The code for this implementation can be found in 'knn_imputation.R'.

For this analysis, first values are set to NaN randomly and functions for imputaion using different distance matrix and caluculating accuracy were created without using inbuilt libraries in R.

# K-Medoids
Implemented k-medoid algorithm for clustering without using inbuilt library of R. The code for this can be found in file 'k_medoids.R'. The data is in 'data_medoids.csv'.

# Naive-Bayes-R
Implementation of Naive bayes algorithm for binary classification without using inbuilt library of R. The code for this implementation can be found in file 'naive_bayes.R'. The data used for this is in 'data_naive_train.csv' and 'data_naive_test.csv' files.

# Sequential-Forward-Selection
The file 'sequential_forward_selection.R' contains a code for Sequential forward selection for Feature selection with 5-Fold stratified cross validation. For the implementation none of the inbuilt R library has been used. The data can be found in 'data_feature_selection.csv'.
